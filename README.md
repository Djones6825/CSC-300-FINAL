# CSC-300-FINAL
Final assingment for CSC 300 Analysis and design


    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  How to import and then manipulate data from a differnet file. Allowing the data to be managed by the program by sorting, removing, and disp[laying the data in ddifferent ways
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I reflected on project I have completed in the past as well as feedback from different professors and community members.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Luckily programming is seen as a community project, there are endless resources from people more than happy to help with similar problems with video resources on youtube and written code from stack overflow
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  If helped me realize how much control I have over preformatted data coming in to a program and how it interacts with the different systems.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Having the stronger focus on notated code with easy reading and being able to change existing code to adapt to new situations
